# Code-Op-Project-1-Individual-BankFraud-EDA

First Final Project [Examination] for Code-Op, 
EDA on Fraudulent Bank Transactions

Fraud Dataset Overview

This dataset is a simulated representation of bank transactions generated by the PaySim Mobile Money Simulator. PaySim models mobile money transactions based on a real sample extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service operating in an African country. A synthetic simulator is used due to the scarcity of publicly and privacy concerns.
